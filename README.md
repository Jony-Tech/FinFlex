In this web app, you can create accounts with provided validations, and subsequently log in with those accounts. The following functions are available:

* Deposit: You can deposit funds into your account, with an upper limit of $10,000 and a lower limit of $0.
* Withdraw: Withdrawals are limited to the available balance in your account, and the withdrawal amount cannot be less than $0.
* Transfer: A transfer function allows you to send money to other accounts. For example, if you create an account "user1" and another account "user2," you can log in with "user1" to transfer money to "user2." You only need the card information or account number of "user1" to initiate the transfer, and vice versa.

The main panel features a card displaying information about the currently active user, and there is also a history of recent transactions where you can review your transaction activity.
